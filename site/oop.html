	<h1>OOP</h1>
	<h3>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. As you can guess from it’s name it breaks the program on the basis of the objects in it. It mainly works on Class, Object, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation and Inheritance. Its aim is to bind together the data and functions to operate on them.

Some of the well-known object-oriented languages are Objective C, Perl, Java, Python, Modula, Ada, Simula, C++, Smalltalk and some Common Lisp Object Standard. Here we are discussing its benefits on C++.OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. As you can guess from it’s name it breaks the program on the basis of the objects in it.

<h1>Advantages Of OOP</h1>
<h3>
	<ul><li>We can build the programs from standard working modules that communicate with one another, rather than having to start writing the code from scratch which leads to saving of development time and higher productivity,
OOP language allows to break the program into the bit-sized problems that can be solved easily (one object at a time).</li>
<li>The new technology promises greater programmer productivity, better quality of software and lesser maintenance cost.</li>
<li>OOP systems can be easily upgraded from small to large systems.</li>
<li>It is possible that multiple instances of objects co-exist without any interference,
<li>It is very easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.</li>
<li>It is possible to map the objects in problem domain to those in the program.</li>
<li>The principle of data hiding helps the programmer to build secure programs which cannot be invaded by the code in other parts of the program.
<li>By using inheritance, we can eliminate redundant code and extend the use of existing classes.</li>
<li>Message passing techniques is used for communication between objects which makes the interface descriptions with external systems much simpler.
The data-centered design approach enables us to capture more details of model in an implementable form.</li></ul></h3>
